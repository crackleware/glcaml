About
-----

This is my fork of glcaml / sdlcaml interfaces, with the intent to
provide a more complete sdl experience as well as bring some github
collaboration and transparency to the development process. I don't like
sourceforge too much.

Currently it improves SDLCaml by providing Sdl_mixer, interface to
audio mixing and playing features of SDL.

I don't plan on doing any "official" releases and won't sweat at providing
backwards compatibility, OCaml is enough of a minority and novelty to
worry about some legacy application breakage.

Still, it is currently fully compatible with the mainline glcaml/sdlcaml.
