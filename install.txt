Installation instructions
==========================

QUICK START

Requirements:
1. The Ocaml compiler (http://caml.inria.fr), version 3.01 or higher
2. Make, version 3.79.1 or higher
3. SDL (http://libsdl.org) must be installed in order to use SDLCaml.
However some examples do not require the use of SDL and may be compiled
and run without SDL 
4. OpenGL drivers must be installed in order to view the examples that use OpenGL

If you are running Unix or have the MinGW installation of OCaml,
and have SDL installed (http://libsdl.org), edit the makefile.
For Unix the makefile can be used unaltered. On Windows the line
# MAKE = make WIN32=true should be uncommented.

To build the examples, type 
	make
This will compile the various examples located in subdirectory /examples	
If you do not have SDL installed type
	make nosdl	
This will compile all the examples located in subdirectory /examples that are
NOT dependent on SDL	

The binaries will be placed in subdirectory /bin

To make the documentation, type
	make htmldoc
The documentation will be placed in subdirectory /doc	

To remove compiled binaries and object files run
	make clean

USING GLCAML IN A SEPARATE PROJECT

Requirements for using GLCaml in a project:
1. The Ocaml compiler (http://caml.inria.fr), version 3.01 or higher

Usage:
GLCaml consists of the following files: 
	glcaml.ml
	glcaml.mli
	glcaml_stub.c
These files are located in the /lib subdirectory of this package.
To use GLCaml in an OCaml project, add these three files to your project
makefiles. You may move them to any suitable directory or location, as
long as the Ocaml compiler is able to find all three files.

Platforms:
GLCaml has been tested on the following platforms
1. Windows XP, with the MinGW distribution of the Ocaml compiler
2. Windows 2000, with the MinGW distribution of the Ocaml compiler
3. Ubuntu Linux (6.06), with the AMD64 version of the Ocaml compiler
4. Mac OS X
5. Solaris 5.10

It should work, but has not been tested on
1. Windows 2000/XP/Vista with the MSVC distribution of the Ocaml compiler
2. Other Linux distributions



REGENERATING GLCAML

GLCaml consists of the following files: 
	glcaml.ml
	glcaml.mli
	glcaml_stub.c
These files are located in the /lib subdirectory of this package.
They may be regenerated using the files located in the /glgen directory:
using the following commands (from the shell or command prompt):
	make
The generated files will be located in /glgen/output and may be copied to 
/lib	


SDLCAML

This package comes with SDLCaml, a compact drop-in binding for LibSDL.
SDLCaml can be used as a small, fast replacement for OcamlSDL.	
It contains the following files
	sdlcaml.ml
	sdlcaml.mli
	sdlcaml_stub.c
located in the /lib subdirectory
Generated, comprehensive documentation is located in the /doc directory
The /examples subdirectory contains a number of SDL tutorials, translated into
Ocaml from the Lazy Foo' Productions tutorials
(http://lazyfooproductions.com/SDL_tutorials/index.php)


WIN

This package also comes with Win, a small library that enables OpenGL
calls to be used from the Ocaml Graphics module, without requiring the presence
of SDL. It contains the following files
	win.ml
	win.mli
	win_stub.c
located in the /lib subdirectory
